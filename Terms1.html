                                <p1>Effective as of June 5, 2023 (view previous version)</p1>
                                <p>Welcome to YouTube Paid Services!</p>

                                <p1>1. Our Service</p1>
                                <p>Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services, and features we
                                make available to you as part of the platform. YouTube enables access to certain premium
                                features or content in exchange for one-time or recurring fees (each a "Paid Service").
                                The Paid Services include YouTube rentals and purchases, channel memberships, paid
                                subscriptions, and other YouTube services which may be offered by Google.</p>

                                <p1>1.1 Your Service Provider</p1>
                                <p>The entity providing the Paid Services is Google LLC, located at 1600 Amphitheatre
                                Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.<br>

                                We may use other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group, now or in the
                                future (these companies are referred to as our “Affiliates”) to manage Paid Services.<br>

                                Any payments you make for the Paid Services will be taken by Google Ireland Limited,
                                located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Together, Google LLC and
                                Google Ireland Limited, are "Google, "we", "us", or "our".</p>

                                <p1>1.2 Applicable Terms</p1>
                                <p>Your transactions and any use of the Paid Services are subject to: these Paid Service
                                Terms of Service; the YouTube Terms of Service; the Paid Service Usage Rules; and the
                                YouTube Community Guidelines. We’ll refer to these documents together as the “Terms”.<br>

                                Please read the Terms carefully and make sure you understand them. If you do not
                                understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you may not use the Paid
                                Services. Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order a
                                subscription or an item of content), you will enter into a separate contract with us for
                                that particular Paid Service and will be asked to accept the Paid Service Terms again.</p>

                                <p1>2. Accessing Paid Services</p1>
                                <p1>2.1 Age Requirements</p1>
                                <p>The age requirements in the YouTube Terms of Service also apply to your use of the Paid
                                Services. You must also comply with any additional age restrictions that might apply for
                                the use of specific Paid Services (for example an age restriction on a movie). Family
                                managers and family members must meet these additional requirements as well.</p>

                                <p1>2.2 Device Requirements and Usage Limits</p1>
                                <p>Certain Paid Services may require you to use a device that meets the system and
                                compatibility requirements for that Paid Service, which may change from time to time.
                                For further information on supported devices and technical requirements, visit our Help
                                Center. There may also be limits on how you can access or use the different types of
                                Paid Services on YouTube (e.g., applicable viewing periods and device limitations).
                                Please see the YouTube Paid Service Usage Rules for more information.</p>

                                <p1>2.3 Geographic Restrictions</p1>
                                <p>The Paid Services, and certain content available within the Paid Services, may only be
                                available in certain countries. You agree that you will not present any false,
                                inaccurate, or misleading information in an effort to misrepresent your country of
                                residence, and you will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or
                                availability of the Paid Services or content available within the Paid Services.</p>

                                <p1>2.4 Other Google Paid Services</p1>
                                <p>In some cases, you may be able to access a Paid Service through other Google products
                                (e.g., you may be able to watch a movie on Google Play that you purchased on YouTube).
                                Additionally, you may be able to access content via YouTube that you have purchased, or
                                subscribed to, through other Google products (e.g. you may be able to watch a movie on
                                YouTube that you purchased on Google Play). Your use of any Paid Service is governed
                                only by the Terms, and not the terms of any other Google product, including any other
                                Google product through which you receive access to a Paid Service.</p>

                                <p1>2.5 Your Information</p1>
                                <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy
                                when you use the Paid Services. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

                                <p1>3. Payment and Free Trials</p1>
                                <p1>3.1 Payment</p1>
                                <p>Google accepts payment via the payment method indicated prior to your purchase. You must
                                have a valid, accepted payment method on file in order to purchase Paid Services, or to
                                participate in no-cost trial offers or other no-cost offers related to the Paid
                                Services. You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order. Google will charge your
                                payment method for the price listed for the relevant Paid Service along with any
                                additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees, and currency fluctuations.
                                If you purchase any automatically renewing Paid Service subscription, you agree that
                                Google will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period
                                for the subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an
                                expired credit card or other reason, and Google is unable to charge you on the next
                                billing period, you may not be able to access the applicable Paid Service until you
                                update your payment method. Where possible, we will provide you with notice when this
                                happens. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time
                                following that notice, Google may cancel your subscription. In some cases, you may
                                transact with a third-party or affiliate platform when you purchase a Paid Service
                                (e.g., if you subscribe to YouTube Premium using another platform like Apple or Google
                                Play). In these cases, such platform will charge your payment method and be responsible
                                for managing any issues with your payment, including refunds.</p>

                                <p1>3.2 Free Trials</p1>
                                <p>Google may offer free trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time. If you
                                purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that includes a trial, you will receive access
                                to that Paid Service for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial
                                period, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription and will
                                continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you
                                must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period.</p>

                                <p1>3.3 Discounts</p1>
                                <p>Google may, from time to time, offer discounts on purchases or subscriptions (such as a
                                YouTube family plan or student plan). Additional terms and conditions, including
                                eligibility criteria, may apply to such plans and any such additional terms will be made
                                available to you prior to purchase.</p>

                                <p1>3.4 Pre-Orders</p1>
                                <p>Google may offer the ability to pre-order certain items of content that are available
                                within the Paid Services. When you place a pre-order, unless otherwise noted at the
                                time, your payment method will not be charged until the date when the relevant item of
                                content is made available to you. You can cancel a pre-order at any time up to the point
                                at which the relevant item of content is made available. In some cases, Google may need
                                to cancel a pre-order you have placed, in which case we will notify you.</p>

                                <p1>3.5 Taxes</p1>
                                <p>If Google is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a
                                Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase
                                transaction.</p>

                                <p1>4. Cancellations and Refunds</p1>
                                <p1>4.1 Cancellation of Subscriptions</p1>
                                <p>If you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that automatically renews, you may
                                cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period. The
                                cancellation will take effect at the end of that billing period. You will retain access
                                to the Paid Service from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period
                                and, unless otherwise indicated in the Refund Policy, you will not receive a refund or
                                credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.</p>

                                <p1>4.2 Cancellation of Purchases or Rentals</p1>
                                <p>You can cancel your purchase and receive a refund as long as you have not commenced
                                using the relevant Paid Service you ordered and you make your request no later than 7
                                working days after your order is completed. We reserve the right to approve or deny
                                refund requests after 7 working days at our sole discretion, except where the Paid
                                Service is defective, in which case the Refund Policy will apply. If you receive a
                                refund for any reason, Google reserves the right to terminate your access to the
                                relevant Paid Service purchased.</p>

                                <p1>4.3 Refunds</p1>
                                <p>Google offers additional rights of refund for several types of Paid Services, including
                                digital content, as set out in the Refund Policy.</p>

                                <p1>5. Licence</p1>
                                <p>After completing a transaction or paying the applicable fees for a Paid Service, you may
                                access and use that Paid Service, for your personal, non-commercial use only, and as
                                long as you comply with the Terms and the law. Your licence to the Paid Services
                                (including any content offered through the Paid Services) is non-exclusive and all
                                rights, title, and interest in the Paid Services not expressly granted to you in these
                                Terms are reserved by Google and its licensors. You agree not to use any Paid Service,
                                in whole or in part, in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is
                                charged (except where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement).</p>

                                <p1>6. Restrictions</p1>
                                <p>When you use the Paid Services, you may not (or attempt to):<br>

                                use the Paid Services in an illegal manner, or for an illegal purpose;<br>
                                share your Google account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid
                                Service they did not order;<br>
                                copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the Paid Services to any third party;<br>
                                circumvent, reverse engineer, modify, disable, or otherwise tamper with any security
                                technology that Google uses to protect the Paid Services or encourage or help anyone
                                else to do so;<br>
                                access the Paid Services other than by means authorised by Google; or<br>
                                remove any proprietary notices or labels on Paid Services (for example watermarks).</p>
                                <p1>7. Changes</p1>
                                <p1>7.1 Changes to the Paid Services</p1>
                                <p>We’re constantly developing new features and ways to improve our services and we may
                                modify the Service (including the Paid Services) as set out in the YouTube Terms of
                                Service. Changes to a Paid Service will not affect your ability to request a refund as
                                described above.</p>

                                <p1>7.2 Removal or Unavailability of Content</p1>
                                <p>The availability of content on a Paid Service may change from time to time, including
                                when content within a Paid Service becomes limited or unavailable due to restrictions

                                <p1>7.3 Changes to Pricing</p1>
                                <p>Prices for Paid Services may change from time to time, for example, to reflect
                                inflation, changes in pricing from our licensors, changes for promotional offerings,
                                changes to the Paid Services, or changing business needs. Google does not provide price
                                protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction, or promotional offering. Any
                                changes to pricing for Paid Services with recurring payments will only apply following
                                reasonable notice to you. If we notify you of a price change for a Paid Service with a
                                recurring payment and you do not want to continue that Paid Service at the new price,
                                you can cancel the Paid Service before the start of the next subscription period in
                                which the new price applies, by following the steps in Section 4 (Cancellation of
                                Subscriptions).</p>

                                <p1>7.4 Changes to this Agreement</p1>
                                <p>Google may change these Paid Service Terms, for example, (1) to reflect changes to our
                                Service or how we do business, e.g., when we add new products or features or remove old
                                ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, safety, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or
                                harm. If we materially change the Paid Service Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable
                                advance notice (except when we launch a new product or feature or in urgent situations,
                                such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements) and an opportunity
                                to cancel any subscriptions. The new Paid Service Terms will be effective after such
                                notice period. Your continued use of a Paid Service following such notice period will
                                indicate your acceptance of the new Paid Service Terms. The new terms will apply to your
                                use of all Paid Service content (including content you have purchased in the past) and
                                all subsequent purchases. If you do not agree to such changes then (i) please cancel any
                                subscriptions you have purchased before the end of the notice period and (ii) you may
                                not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest version of the Paid Service Terms
                                that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased Paid
                                Services.</p>
