                                <p>As described in the YouTube Paid Service Terms of Service, how you access or use
                                different types of Paid Services on YouTube may vary. The usage rules applicable to each
                                type of Paid Service are detailed below, and may change over time as we add new
                                features, devices and content to our service. You may also visit the YouTube Help Center
                                for more information.<br><br>

                                <p1>Movies and Shows Rentals and Purchases</p1><br><br>
                                A. <p1>General.</p1> Certain types of Paid Services allow you to purchase or rent individual Movies
                                or TV shows made available by third parties. You may view rentals or purchases when
                                online, with a broadband connection and logged onto your YouTube or Google account. You
                                may also view certain rentals and purchases offline by downloading and viewing from a
                                previously authorized device. Authorizing and deauthorizing a device requires you to be
                                online. Due to restrictions from our content providers, purchased or rented content may
                                not be available for purchase in all countries or outside of your home country.<br><br>
                                B. <p1>Access on other Google Products.</p1> In some cases, you may also receive access to your
                                rentals and purchases through another Google product (e.g. Google Play). Your use of
                                your rentals and purchases from YouTube shall be governed by the YouTube usage rules,
                                but these usage rules will govern your use on these Google products in addition to any
                                usage rules applicable to the other Google products.<br><br>
                                C. <p1>Rental Content.</p1> When you rent content, you may view such item of content an unlimited
                                number of times during the period of time displayed at the time of your payment
                                ("Viewing Period") and noted in your confirmation email. Pausing, stopping, or rewinding
                                an item of rented content will not extend your applicable Viewing Period. Each item of
                                rented content may have a different Viewing Period, so please review the Viewing Period
                                before you complete your transaction. Rented content may only be viewed on one device at
                                a time (either online or on an authorized offline device).<br><br>
                                D. <p1>Purchased Content.</p1> When you purchase an item of content, your content will be stored in
                                a digital locker and you may view it an unlimited number of times for during your Locker
                                Period. The “Locker Period” will be for at least 5 years from the date of your purchase
                                (subject to the restrictions described in the YouTube Paid Service Terms of Service).
                                Each item of purchased content may have a different Locker Period and you agree to the
                                Locker Period before you order it. Pausing, stopping, or rewinding purchased content
                                will not extend the Locker Period. As noted in the YouTube Paid Service Terms of
                                Service, if an item of purchased content becomes unavailable during the five year period
                                from the purchase date, you may request a refund.<br><br>

                                <ol>

                                    <li>you may view up to 3 streams of different items at a time,</li>

                                    and to authorize additional devices, you must deauthorize one of those 5 devices,</li>
                                    <li>you may only authorize the same device three times in any 12 month period and
                                    de-authorize the same device twice in any 12 month period,</li>
                                    <li>you may only deauthorize a total of 2 devices for offline playback every 90 days, and</li>
                                    <li>you may only authorize 3 Google accounts on the same device.</li> 
                                </ol>
                               Stream and offline playback limitations for purchased content apply regardless of which
                                Google product (e.g., Google Play Movies & TV or YouTube) you access the content from.</p>
