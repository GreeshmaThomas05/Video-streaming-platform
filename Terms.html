                  <p>Dated: January 5, 2022</p><br>

                  <h4>TERMS OF SERVICE</h4><br>
                  <h5>Welcome to YouTube!</h5>
                  <p1>Introduction</p1>

                  <p>Thank you for using the YouTube products, services and features provided to you from the platform
                  (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

                  <p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for
                  people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform
                  for original content creators and advertisers large and small. We provide lots of information about
                  our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Among other things, you can find out about
                  YouTube Kids, the YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases (where

                  <p>The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware,
                  located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”,
                  or “our”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the
                  Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).</p>

                  <p1>Applicable Terms</p1>

                  <p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy,

                  Agreement.<br>

                  Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the
                  Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.<br>

                  years of age, the restrictions and requirements below apply.</p>

                  <h5>Who may use the Service?</h5>
                  <p1>Age Requirements</p1>
                  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service; however, children of all ages may use the
                  Service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.<br>

                  Permission by Parent or Guardian<br>

                  If you are considered a minor in your country, you represent that you have your parent or guardian’s
                  permission to use the Service. Please have them read this Agreement with you.<br>

                  If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor in your country, by allowing your child to use the
                  Service, you are subject to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on
                  the Service. You can find tools and resources to help you manage your family’s experience on YouTube

                  <p1>Businesses</p1>

                  <h5>Your Use of the Service</h5>
                  <p1>Content on the Service</p1>
                  <p>The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics,
                  photos, text (such as comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service
                  marks, or logos), interactive features, software, metrics, and other materials (collectively,
                  "Content”).<br>

                  Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. YouTube is
                  under no obligation to host or serve Content. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with

                  <p1>Google Accounts and YouTube Channels</p1>

                  <p>You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a Google
                  account. However, you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be
                  able to like videos, subscribe to channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow
                  these instructions to create a Google account.<br>

                  Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as
                  uploading videos, making comments or creating playlists (where available). Here are some details about
                  how to create your own YouTube channel.<br>

                  To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google
                  account password on third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure,
                  including what to do if you learn of any unauthorised use of your password or Google account.</p>

                  <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the
                  Service. The YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices
                  that are specific to YouTube Kids.<br>

                  We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the

                  <p1>Reservation</p1>

                  <p>Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including

                  <p1>Develop, Improve and Update the Service</p1>

                  <p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may
                  make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and
                  functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need
                  to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security
                  improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our
                  systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user. When the Service
                  requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may
                  update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device
                  settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide
                  you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding
                  to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an
                  opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to
                  applicable law and policies.</p>

                  <p1>Copyright Protection</p1>
                  <p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our
                  YouTube Copyright Center. If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send
                  us a notice.<br>

                  We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube
                  Copyright Center, where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike.
                  YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’
                  access to the Service.</p>

                  <h5>Account Suspension & Termination</h5>
                  <p1>Terminations by You</p1>

                  <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Service from your
                  Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the
                  option to download a copy of your data first.</p>

                  <p1>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube</p1>

                  <p>YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part
                  of the Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do
                  so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that
                  creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>

                  <p1>Notice for Termination or Suspension</p1>

                  <p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably
                  believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority;
                  (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of
                  the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where
                  YouTube is terminating your use for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided
                  with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</p>

                  <p1>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</p1>
                  <p>If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue
                  using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement
                  will continue to apply to such use. If you believe that the termination or suspension of your Google
                  account has been made in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
